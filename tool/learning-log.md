## Tool: **Animate.css**

---

### X/X/XX:
* used [ Animate.css ](https://animate.style/) and read through it
* watched a beginner tortial to get a better understanding [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzbBcVRquYA)
* I modified the code by changing the animation from "`bounce`" to "`flash`"
    * allowing me to see how different effects function.
* tried using animate_repeat to make it last longer
    * but I realised it can only do up to 3 times
    * I changed the repeat to infinite so now it just keep bouncing up and down without stopping
* Next time I will try to expand my learning and try more cool animations
* animation borders
