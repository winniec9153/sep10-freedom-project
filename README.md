# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Winnie Chen**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing. For my project, I chose the topic of **Music Production** because I am curious by how all these great music I listen to get created. In this freedom project we have to create an innovation in which i created the Mood Adapt Music Player which is a cool device which can give you a personalized music recomendation based on your current mood and speech. So in order to create this website I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **Animate.CSS** in order to help me make my website better. I kept all my notes of my progress of studying this tool in my learning log.
### Step for creating this website:
1. Think of a possible topic
2. Research about this topic which include software & hardware(Music prodction)
3. Create a possible innovation for the Music prodction world
4. Choose a tool which in my case I choose [**Animate.css**](https://animate.style/)
5. Tinker with tool
6. Create wireframe for my wesbite(layout)
7. Create website(MVP/Beyond MVP)
8. Presentation(in class presntation and EXPO Elevator pitch)

## Implications
##### PROS
* My project of **Music Production** has a positive impact on _society_, specifically _culture_, _relationships_, and _individuals_.
    * Music production allows individuals and groups to express themselves, with a blend of culture, arts, and technology into music. These music pieces can be used to express our feelings, turning inspirations into sounds. For my project, I created this innovation of a Mood Adapt Music Player, which is an innovation that can be used to express how you feel through music. For example, when you are sad, happy, or calm, this device is able to pick up how you feel and turn it into music based on what you feel. 
* My project of **Music Production** has a positive impact on _economic jobs_, _finance_, and _infrastructure_:
    * Creates more jobs for individuals, so music production supports many jobs like: producers, sound engineers, songwriters, studio technicians, marketers, and more.
    * It also fuels the freelance world, most certainly in the online space like YouTube, Instagram, and other streaming platforms.
    * Gains personal income, so successful producers can earn a good amount of money from these.
    * Attracts investors through deals.
    * Drives creation of recording studios and pushes growth on online platforms.

##### CONS
* My project on **Music Production** won't benefit the _global/environment_:
    * Lots of energy consumption, as in the music production world, computers, software, and data storage are being used frequently, so it consumes a lot of electricity.
    * It creates a high carbon footprint, as large concerts are being in session.
