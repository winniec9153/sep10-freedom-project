**Brainstorming Part B:**  
I've been working on my freedom project for SEP, working on Part B which is thinking about innovations that have not been discovered yet by other people. My topic Is Music so I did some research to see the problems people face in music production. In [aulart](https://www.aulart.com/blog/6-solutions-to-pain-points-in-music-production/?srsltid=AfmBOoo9_ALKiJJ3M5eHyegPsCbPYNZ6P1uPkl7tFDKQm8Toh1xMocdc) it discusses the problem people face is music production such as finding the perfect sound for a track as it can be a frustrating and time-consuming process. I noticed that many music creators or people in general have a hard time thinking of the right music and lyrics to express what they are feeling. So by using this information, I thought of this innovation which I call the "Brain wave music generator." This device connects to your brainwaves, allowing you to compose music directly by thinking. The device would interpret your emotions, thoughts, and cognitive patterns and translate them into musical notes, rhythms, and arrangements. This could allow musicians to create complex compositions without needing traditional instruments or even their hands.
We can do this by having a brain connected computer to pick up brain signals to convert thoughts into music. I feel like this innovation can truly help people who struggle to find the right sound or music that clearly expresses what they feel. Another challenge people face in music production is being able to try out diffferent instrument for song production. In [forum](https://forums.songstuff.com/topic/59402-overcoming-challenges-in-music-production-share-your-stories/) I am able to see the challenge Some people face, I notice people can't find the right pitch and aren't able to know how other instruments sound like especially since it is expensive. So after some brainstorming, I came up with a "VR music world" where musicians can step into a 3D world full of instruments, consoles, and different sound/audio effects. They can interact with these instruments and these VR headsets are paired with motion-tracking gloves or full-body sensors which would allow musicians to interact with virtual soundscapes. With haptic(sense of touch but more precise) feedback, users can "feel" sound waves and vibrations, making the music creation process more tactile and expressive. This innovation would be really life changing in the music world.

**Finalizing all my content so that it's ready for the website:**  
My topic Is Music so I did a FreedomProject Content of my topic to get ready to plan out for our website. We had to do Part A which is about tech invention about our topic. My topic is Music so i did research on Hardware and software technolgy related to music and I organized my software list through popularity. From 1 to be most well-known and the bottom is the least known among people. For hardware I organized it thorugh when the invention was first released. With the instrument being the oldest and the Hologram Microcosm being the most recent. For part B I had to think about music innovations that can be used in the music industry. I am doing this by using my creativity to think of one and brainstorming for future innovations related to Music.

### Engineering Design Process:   
For my next steep in this engineering design process I am going to Imagine and find possible solution for problems in the music production industry. 
### Skills:
Some skills I got  was researching skills as it became even more better than before. I had to research on problems people faced in the music industry/ production. I did alot of digging and use my creativity to think of an innovation that had not been discovered yet that might be benneficial in the music world. Another skill have is
