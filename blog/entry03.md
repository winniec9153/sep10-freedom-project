**Brainstorming Part B:**  
I've been working on my freedom project for SEP, working on Part B which is thinking about innovations that have not been discovered yet by other people. My topic Is Music so I did some research to see the problems people face in music production. In [aulart](https://www.aulart.com/blog/6-solutions-to-pain-points-in-music-production/?srsltid=AfmBOoo9_ALKiJJ3M5eHyegPsCbPYNZ6P1uPkl7tFDKQm8Toh1xMocdc) it discusses the problem people face is music production such as finding the perfect sound for a track as it can be a frustrating and time-consuming process. I noticed that many music creators or people in general have a hard time thinking of the right music and lyrics to express what they are feeling. So by using this information, I thought of this innovation which I call the "Brain wave music generator." This device connects to your brainwaves, allowing you to compose music directly by thinking. The device would interpret your emotions, thoughts, and cognitive patterns and translate them into musical notes, rhythms, and arrangements. This could allow musicians to create complex compositions without needing traditional instruments or even their hands.
We can do this by having a brain connected computer to pick up brain signals to convert thoughts into music. I feel like this innovation can truly help people who struggle to find the right sound or music that clearly expresses what they feel. Another challenge people face in music production is being able to try out diffferent instrument for song production. In [forum](https://forums.songstuff.com/topic/59402-overcoming-challenges-in-music-production-share-your-stories/) I am able to see the challenge some people face, I notice people can't find the right pitch and aren't able to know how other instruments sound like especially since it is expensive. So after some brainstorming, I came up with a "VR music world" where musicians can step into a 3D world full of instruments, consoles, and different sound/audio effects. They can interact with these instruments and these VR headsets are paired with motion-tracking gloves or full-body sensors which would allow musicians to interact with virtual soundscapes. With haptic(sense of touch but more precise) feedback, users can "feel" sound waves and vibrations, making the music creation process more tactile and expressive. This innovation would be really life changing in the music world.

**Finalizing all my content so that it's ready for the website:**  
My topic Is Music so I did a FreedomProject Content of my topic to get ready to plan out for our website. We had to do Part A which is about tech invention about our topic. My topic is Music so i did research on Hardware and software technolgy related to music and I organized my software list through popularity. From 1 to be most well-known and the bottom is the least known among people. For hardware I organized it thorugh when the invention was first released. With the instrument being the oldest and the Hologram Microcosm being the most recent. For part B I had to think about music innovations that can be used in the music industry. I am doing this by using my creativity to think of one and brainstorming for future innovations related to Music.

### Engineering Design Process:   
For my next step in this engineering design process, I am going to find possible solutions to problems in the music production industry. For my last blog, I found out that people have issues with when music goes digital then it becomes easy for others to copy and share it without paying. This is unfair to the owner of the music. To address this issue, DRM is often used to prevent illegal copying and sharing of music. However, many still find ways to bypass these measures, downloading music for free. This leads to significant financial losses for artists and music companies. While the internet and digital formats have made it easier to share music globally, they have also increased unauthorized copying. Moreover, DRM can frustrate users as it may not be compatible with all devices or software. A potential solution is implementing a more efficient, fair, and transparent system for managing artists' rights. Such a system would better support both creators and listeners, fostering a balanced and mutually beneficial environment. A solution to this problem is enhancing DRM Systems so how it works is it develop more robust DRM systems that encrypt digital music files and restrict unauthorized copying or sharing. 
### Skills:
I have significantly improved my research skills, particularly while searching into the challenges faced in the music industry and production. This process required extensive investigation, critical thinking, and the ability to sift through vast amounts of information to identify key issues. I also relied on my creativity to brainstorm innovative ideas that have not yet been discovered but could bring valuable advancements to the world of music. In addition to research, I also have communication skills, which are essential when collaborating with others or addressing complex challenges. When faced with difficulties, I make a conscious effort to express my thoughts clearly and confidently while remaining open to alternative ideas, opinions, and perspectives. This openness not only helps me articulate my views effectively but also enables me to understand and appreciate different viewpoints. By doing so, I foster productive discussions and create an environment that encourages collaboration and mutual respect. These skills combined—research, creativity, and effective communication—allow me to approach challenges with a well-rounded and thoughtful perspective.
