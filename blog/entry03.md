I been working on my freedom project for SEP, thinking about new innoavation that had not been discovered yet by other people. My topic Is Music so I did a FreedomProject Content my topic to get ready to plan out for our website. We had to do Part A which is about tech invention about our topic. My topic is Music so i did research on Hardware and software technolgy related to music and I organized my software list through popularity. From 1 to being most well known and the bottom is the least known among people. For hardware I organized it thorugh when the invention was first released. With insturment being the oldest and Hologram Microcosm being the most recent. For part B I had to think about A music innvation that can be used in the music industry. I am doing this by using my creativity to think of one. Brainstorming for the Future innovations related to Music.
