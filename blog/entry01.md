### Choosing a topic    

---
 The topic that I have decided on was music because i feel like music is a good way to express your emotions and thoughts. I choose music becasue i was intrigued by the music producer I see onlne making music, song, and writing lyrics. I find it very facinating. Some backup ideas that I was going to considered were badminton and cooking as these were topics that I was also passionate about. Some of the article I used for researched based on music was [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) Aleton makes software, hardware and other creative tools for a global community of music makers, it have a wide range of different type of music and production. This article have different section of reading realted to music. Another article that i find facinating was [Soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/content/blog/how-to-produce-music),this article teaches us on how music production work and its essentials.
### Engineering Design Process

 I am currently on the first stage of the Engineering Designprocess, where I will try to find certain issues that music producer and the industry face. I am inspired to solve these issues using the world of technology in the music world. My plans for the future is to design a website that can help solve problems within music production accessibilty,giving us a opportunity to have high quality production for a accesible price.
 ### Skills
 ---
 Some skills i have is that I have good communications skills and good time management. When faced with problem I try my best to solve it by expressing my thoughts clearly, I also am willing to consider new ideas and opinion, understanding both perspective. I considered myself as someone who have good time mangement becasue I have alarm scheduled for certain task so when I know I have an important assignment or homework, I will put it in my notes so I know i will go back to do it and hand it in, in time. So I focus on high priority task and set clear goals by breaking them my larger goals into smaller ones, this helps me accomplish them easier and faster.
