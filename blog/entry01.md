### Choosing a topic    

---
The topic that I have decided on was music because i feel like music is a good way to express your emotions and thoughts. I choose music because I was intrigued by the music producer I see online making music, song, and writing lyrics as I find it very fascinating. Some backup ideas that I was going to consider were badminton and cooking as these were topics that I was also passionate about. Some of the articles I used for research based on music was [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) Ableton is a global company that provides software, hardware, and other creative tools to a diverse community of music makers, it has a wide range of different types of music and production. This article has a different section of reading related to music. Another article that I find fascinating was [Soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/content/blog/how-to-produce-music), this article teaches us on how music production works and its essentials.
### Engineering Design Process
---
 I am currently on the first stage of the Engineering Design Process, where I will try to find certain issues that music producers and the industry face. I am inspired to solve these issues using the world of technology in the music world. My plans for the future is to design a website that can help solve problems within music production accessibility, giving us an opportunity to have high quality production for an accessible price.

 ### Skills
 ---
 Some skills I have are good communications skills and good time management. When faced with challenges, I try my best to express my thoughts clearly and willing to consider new ideas, opinions and perspectives allowing me to understand a different viewpoint. I consider myself as someone who has good time management because I set alarms and reminders for important assignments and organize my priorities effectively. I also create detailed notes so I can stay on track and make sure that I will complete everything on time. So I focus on high priority tasks and set clear goals by breaking them into smaller ones, which helps me stay focused and accomplish them easier and faster.
