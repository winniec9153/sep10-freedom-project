### Choosing a topic    
 The topic that I have decided on was music becaus i feel like music is a good way to express your emotions and thoughts. I choose music becasue i was intrigued by the music producer onlne making music, song, and writing lyrics. I find it very facinating. Some backup ideas that I was going to considered were badminton and cooking as these were topics that I was also passionate about. Some of the article I used for researched based on music was [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) Aleton makes software, hardware and other creative tools for a global community of music makers, it have a wide range of different type of music and production. This article have different section of reading realted to music. Another article that i find facinating was [Soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/content/blog/how-to-produce-music), this article teaches us on how music production work and is  essential.
