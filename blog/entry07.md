## Content:
We were assigned to create a [slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tOF5urT0LOsIHtkWUp56a8_zF3IWzCgb1VtYLtUnOvY/edit?slide=id.g35a01fbbaa6_0_4#slide=id.g35a01fbbaa6_0_4) of our freedom project to the class and also had to do an Expo Elevator Pitch script for our freedom project which I wrote down in my [SEP10 Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ltw318VSVfn_SVYxbgqVjAXyWlnoDki4R_t0wh6KhT8/edit?tab=t.0  ) There were student judges who came around grading our elevator expo pitch. So for the Google slide presentation to the class, we had to include a hook to capture the people's attention. We also needed a process, Product, and conclusion. So for the Product, I included my [website link](https://winniec9153.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/index.html#context ) on my slide to show people what the product is. For the Process, I showed them my wireframe and the tool I used which is Animate. Css and the bootstrap components I used. I also gave a brief talk about the software and hardware that is used in Music Production(my topic) and also the innovation I created that may benefit the _Music Production world_. So for my conclusion, I talked about the benefits of _Music Production_ and some takeaways I had making my website. During the Expo elevator pitch, I did almost the same steps. I included a hook, gave them a brief explanation about _Music Production_, and showed them my software, hardware, and innovation. I also showed them the tools I used and the bootstrap component that is included in my website. I also showed them the responsiveness of my website by going into inspect mode.
### Takeaways from in-class presentation:
---
**Talking a little slower**  

So during the presnetation I got a little nervous and started talking alittle fast. This may impact the people as they may not hear everything i said as I was going to fast. So for future presnetations I will talk alittle slower so people can have a clear understandig on what im saying. Also allowing them to process everyhting I said better.

**Making my takeaways more specific**  

So when creating my slide my takeaways werent as specific as it was to vague. So anyone can have the same takeawyas as me. For example I put "time managemnt is key", I cpuld had change that made it alittle more specific to me by saying why it is key and why I should use my time more wisely.

### Takeaways for Expo elevator pitch:
---
**Say what you know**  

In the beginning, before the judge came up, I was super nervous and scared I was going to mess up. I kept practicing my script hoping I remember it all. Once the judge was at my section and grading me I just ended up saying what I know about my topic and my website. I didn't stick to the script I wrote and just used my head. Although the script did help me a little when these judges asked specific questions, the script I wrote wouldn't always have the answer. I have to use my knowledge and head to answer these questions.

## Engineering design process
We are currently in the last few steps of the Engineering design process. Testing it out, improving it, and communicating the result. So I test out my product which is the website to make sure it works properly and check to see if it needs any improvement before I present it in from of classmates, judges, and students. I did that during the in-class presentation and the Expo elevator pitch where I showed off my hard work to others showing them my process and the result I got from it. 

## Skills:
One skill that was used and gained more when creating this project was my creativity and time management. Creativity was one of the parts that the judge graded on so I had to use my creativity to make my website stand out from the others. Although it wasn't as creative, I thought of something that I know many others didn't do. I added a little quote I got and put it on the bottom of my website, the footers. Also, time management is essential because, during the time period of creating this website, I had a lot of other stuff to do as well. I had to use my time wisely, splitting it up so I know for sure I have time to make my website and do other things too.
