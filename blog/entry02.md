#### Researching about music 
---
In this entry, I was asked to researching about the software and hardware connected to music, I was able to find a few that best coordinate with what I am researching about. My first search was trying to find music software. I searched on Google, “Music software” and I was able to find a few website related to it but the one that stand out the out was [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) This website is a website where you can make software and other interesting, creative tools for a diverse community, it is commonly used in hip hop and electronic dance music. One of the best choices for music producers and songwriters. I was trying to find some hardware tools that is used in music production so I tried searching up "Music hardware." This wasn't really good as it wasnt really direct on what I needed. It deosnt explain much So I revised it and added gadget, “ Music hardware gadget” this led me to this [Composercode](https://composercode.com/equipment-for-making-music-my-favorite-production-gear-2022/  ) . This website is really informative and give a good explantion on how these hardware are being used, and also gave a good list of recommondation of technologies for beginners. This website gave me a few hardware that are used frequently in the music industry and the basic studd need for music production.  
**Known Hardwares**:
* PC
  * A personal computer 
* MIDI controller
  * A virtual instrument
* Audio interface
  * Used if you want to record it to your computer software using microphone, keyboard or guitar
  *Used to connect your computer to your studio monitor speaker
* Headphones.
* Studio monitors
  * Used to mix music, audio, sound effects during recording
* Microphones & microphone gear.
* Instruments
  * a tool for making music
* Miscellaneous percussion
  * To keep rhythm and make special sounds
  * Add color and excitement  
  
Also by using Ai(Chat GPT), I found these hardware tools I never knew existed. Some examples are Innovative instruments, Specialized Audio Interfaces, Unique Synthesizers, Drum Machines and Samplers, Effects Processors, Field Recorders, MIDI Controllers, etc. These pieces of hardware represent just a glimpse into the vast world of music equipment beyond the mainstream. They can inspire creativity and enhance your music-making process.

#### Engineering Design process

Right now I am currently on the stage of researching about the hardware and software technologies connected to music. I got down to the basics of what hardware is used and how software is essential in music production. Now I am trying to identify the major problem that people face in the music industry. One I found was digital rights management (DRM) and privacy. The problem is that when music goes digital, it becomes easy for others to copy and share it without paying. This is unfair to the owner of the music. To stop this, people try to use DRM to prevent illegal copying and sharing, but many still find ways around it—downloading music for free. This impact causes artists and music companies to lose much money. While this allowed for greater accessibility as the rise of the internet and digital format made it easier to spread music globally, it also made people copy music without permission. Also, DRM can create a frusurating experience as it does not work with all devices or software. So a way to resolve this problem is by providing a more efficient, fair, and transparent system for managing the rights of the artist. So by doing this, it can create an environment that better supports both the creator (artist) and the consumer (people listening to the music).

#### Skills:

My skills have progressed since the last time I wrote my blog. Now, I have a better understanding of _CSS_, as I know the basics of _CSS_ and _HTML_, and how to style my _HTML_ code. I’ve also improved my research skills, as I am now able to find data, gather information, and use keywords to help with my research. Being able to find reliable sources, such as books, articles, or websites, is key to ensuring the work is accurate and credible. Research also involves asking specific questions, staying organized, and figuring out how to put everything together in a way that makes sense, as well as collecting facts that are true and informative. I use this skill when researching my topic on music production in software and hardware, where I take keywords like "gadgets" and "technologies" into my search to get more accurate results.
