#### Researching about music 
In this entry, I was asked to researching about the software and hardware connected to music, I was able to find a few that best coordinate with what I am researching about. My first search was trying to find music software. I searched on Google, “Music software” and I was able to find a few website related to it but the one that stand out the out was [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) This website is a website where you can make software and other interesting, creative tools for a diverse community, it is commonly used in hip hop and electronic dance music. One of the best choices for music producers and songwriters. I was trying to find some hardware tools that is used in music production so I tried searching up "Music hardware."

It deosnt explain much So I revised it and added gadget, “ Music hardware gadget” this led me to this [Composercode](https://composercode.com/equipment-for-making-music-my-favorite-production-gear-2022/  ) .
