#### Researching about music 
In this entry, I was asked to researching about the software and hardware connected to music, I was able to find a few that best coordinate with what I am researching about. My first search was trying to find music software. I searched on Google, “Music software” and I was able to find a few website related to it but the one that stand out the out was [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) This website is a website where you can make software and other interesting, creative tools for a diverse community, it is commonly used in hip hop and electronic dance music. One of the best choices for music producers and songwriters. I was trying to find some hardware tools that is used in music production so I tried searching up "Music hardware." This wasn't really good as it wasnt really direct on what I needed. It deosnt explain much So I revised it and added gadget, “ Music hardware gadget” this led me to this [Composercode](https://composercode.com/equipment-for-making-music-my-favorite-production-gear-2022/  ) . This website is really informative and give a good explantion on how these hardware are being used, and also gave a good list of recommondation of technologies for beginners. This website gave me a few hardware that are used frequently in the music industry and the basic studd need for music production.  
**Known Hardwares**:
* PC
  * A personal computer 
* MIDI controller
  * A virtual instrument
* Audio interface
  * Used if you want to record it to your computer software using microphone, keyboard or guitar
  *Used to connect your computer to your studio monitor speaker
* Headphones.
* Studio monitors
  * Used to mix music, audio, sound effects during recording
* Microphones & microphone gear.
* Instruments
  * a tool for making music
* Miscellaneous percussion
  * To keep rhythm and make special sounds
  * Add color and excitement  
  
Also by using Ai(Chat GPT), I found these hardware tools I never knew existed. Some examples are Innovative instruments, Specialized Audio Interfaces, Unique Synthesizers, Drum Machines and Samplers, Effects Processors, Field Recorders, MIDI Controllers, etc. These pieces of hardware represent just a glimpse into the vast world of music equipment beyond the mainstream. They can inspire creativity and enhance your music-making process.

#### Engineering Design process 
Right now I am currently on the stage of researching about the hardware and soft-ware technoligies connected to music. I got down the basic of what hardware is used and how software is an essentail in the music production, now I  am trying to identify the major problem that people face in the music industry. One i found was digital right management(DRM) and piracy. The problem is that when music go digital, iit become easy for others to copy and share it without paying. This is unfair to the owner of the music. To stop this peole try to use DRM to prevent illegal copying and sharing, but many still find ways around it, downloading music for free. This impact cause artist and music companies to lose many money. While this allow for greator accesibily as the rise of the internet and digital format made it easier to spread music gloablly, it also make peope copy music without permission. Also DRM can create a frusurating ecperience as it does not work with all devices or software. So a way to resolve this problem is by providing a more efficient, fair, and trasparent system for manging right of the artist. So by doing this, it can create an environment that better support both the creator(artist) and the consumer(people listening to the music).
