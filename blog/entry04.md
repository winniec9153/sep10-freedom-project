The tool I am deciding to use is [Animate.css](https://animate.style/#documentation) because this tool have tons of many cool animations and it seems capabe to use on my skill level. I decided to tinker with this tool by trying to code it on [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/qideqoxadu/edit?html,output). I tried the bouncing animations by looking at example codes. I also change some of the codes to as i cahnge "bounce" to "flash." Trying to get a better understanding on how it works and how the animation woul look like.
