The tool I have chosen to use is **[Animate.css](https://animate.style/#documentation)** because it offers a wide variety of cool animations and is beginner-friendly*, making it a great fit for my current skill level. This library provides pre-built CSS animations that can be easily applied to elements with minimal coding, allowing me to enhance my projects without having to create animations from scratch. To experiment with this tool, I decided to tinker with it using **[JSBin](https://jsbin.com/qideqoxadu/edit?html,output)**, an online coding platform. I first tested the bouncing animation by referencing example codes from the documentation. Then, I modified the code by changing the animation from `"bounce"` to `"flash"`, allowing me to see how different effects function. Through this hands-on approach, I gained a better understanding of how Animate.css works, how animations are applied, and how simple adjustments can create different visual effects. This experience helped me feel more confident in using animation libraries to bring more dynamic and engaging elements to my projects.
