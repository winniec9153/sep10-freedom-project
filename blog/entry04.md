The tool I have chosen to use is **[Animate.css](https://animate.style/#documentation)** because it offers a wide variety of cool animations and is beginner-friendly*, making it a great fit for my current skill level. This library provides pre-built CSS animations that can be easily applied to elements with minimal coding, allowing me to enhance my projects without having to create animations from scratch. To experiment with this tool, I decided to tinker with it using **[Pickcode](https://app.pickcode.io/project/cm7qqw0ysn2phemhdb00p4der)**, an online coding platform. I first tested the bouncing animation by referencing example codes from the documentation. Then, I modified the code by changing the animation from `"bounce"` to `"flash"`, allowing me to see how different effects function. Through this hands-on approach, I gained a better understanding of how Animate.css works, how animations are applied, and how simple adjustments can create different visual effects. I also tried using `animate_repeat` to make it last longer but I realised it can only do up to 3 times. So i chnaged the repeat to infinite so now it just keep bouncing up and down without stopping. By doing this it will keep repeating. This experience helped me feel more confident in using animation libraries to bring more dynamic and engaging elements to my projects.

### Changing bounce to flash:
**Bouces form:**
``` HTML
   <body>
      <div class="animate__animated animate__bounce">
        <h1>hello today is a saturday!!!!</h1>
      </div>
    </body>
```
**Flash form:**
``` HTML
<body>
      <div class="animate__animated animate__flash">
        <h1>hello today is a saturday!!!!</h1>
      </div>
    </body>
```
### Making it go on repeat 
So it was orginially `animate__repeat-3	3` and i changed it to `animate__infinite	infinite`

## Skills: 
Based on this experience, I developed several skills. I learned how to use animation libraries, which gave me hands-on experience working with Animate.css. I also learned how to apply pre-built animations to elements. Additionally, I improved my problem-solving skills when I encountered a limitation with animate_repeat and found an alternative solution by using infinite to achieve the effect I wanted. Another skill I developed was enhancing my projects by exploring how animations make web projects more engaging and dynamic. Lastly, I gained experience using basic CSS to improve the visual effects of my code.
