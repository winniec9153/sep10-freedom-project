# Entry 6
##### 5/6/25

## Context: 
I was assigned to create a website for the Freedom Project, and my topic was [Music Production](https://winniec9153.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/). I completed this by working through the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). To achieve this, I first had to plan everything out. I created a timeline outlining what I would do on specific days and followed a wireframe to guide the design and layout of my website. I also incorporated Bootstrap components like the navbar, cards, and carousel, which I got from [GetBootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), to improve the overall design of my website. Additionally, I added animations like slide-in effects to make the site more visually appealing. I experimented with different color schemes and eventually chose a dark gray and blue combination that I felt looked the best.

## Challenges
A **challenge** I faced was with the navbar—I forgot how to make it fixed so it would stay at the top as I scrolled through the website. I overcame this issue by doing a bit of research and reviewing my old notes. It was super simple, I just needed to added `fixed-top` to my nav class.

Another **challenge** I had was with the sizing of the cards. One of the cards wasn't the same height as the others, which made the layout look uneven. I solved this by researching the problem and asking for help from peers. I added the class h-100, which set the height to 100%, making all the cards the same height and improving the overall look. 

**As you can see here the cards are now all even by applying:**
``` HTML
  <div class="card h-100">
```

Some takeaways I had while making my MVP were the importance of keeping my code organized. I did this by adding comments so I could easily find where everything is and understand what certain parts of the code do. In HTML, you can add comments using <!-- text -->. This helps you locate sections in your code more easily. For example, I’m building a website about music production, and one of the sections is about music software. Since the code for that section is quite long, it can get confusing to find specific parts. To make it easier, I added a comment—shown as green text in the editor—to label that section clearly.

## Engineering Desgin Process:
We are currently creating this prototype for our website to see if it actually works well. While developing the website, we created a plan that includes a timeline for when everything should be completed, as well as a wireframe showing how the website will be structured. We designed wireframes for both [laptop](https://wireframe.cc/fxaypF) and [mobile devices](https://wireframe.cc/zl1GFI) to ensure the site is responsive. We then built the prototype by following the wireframe and putting together everything we had planned. Our next step is to go beyond the MVP and evaluate the prototype to identify any problems.

## Skills
Some skills I developed and gained through this process of making a website are web development skills. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap more effectively, using my new knowledge to add components like navbars, cards, and carousels to build a fully functioning website. I also strengthened my problem-solving skills, as I now have more experience with it. I improved my ability to solve coding issues by researching the errors I encountered, experimenting with solutions, and asking my peers for help—like when I was having trouble with the navbar and card sizing.
