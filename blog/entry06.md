# Entry 6
##### 5/6/25

## Context: 
I was asgined to make a website for this freedom project, completing the MVP. Inrder to make the MVP, i had to plan everyhting out. I made a timeline on what i was oging to do on certain days. I also had a wire frame for which i followed to complete my MVP. I used components like navbar, cards, and carrosel. FOr the navbar i forgot how to make it fix, meaning stay on the top as i scroll through the website. I figured it out how to do it after doing alittle researchng and going back to my old notes. I also had trouble making the card on the right size, but i figured out trhough looking back at my notes. So what happened with my card was that it wasnt the same shape as the other cards. I fix this by researching about my problem and asking peers. I added `h-100` which alloed the height to be the full size. This helped make the card size even.
