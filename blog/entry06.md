# Entry 6
##### 5/6/25

## Context: 
I was asgined to make a website for this freedom project, completing the MVP. Inrder to make the MVP, i had to plan everyhting out. I made a timeline on what i was oging to do on certain days. I also had a wire frame for which i followed to complete my MVP. I used components like navbar, cards, and carrosel.   
A **challenge** I had with the navbar was that I forgot how to make it fixed, meaning stay on the top as i scroll through the website. I overcome this challnge after doing alittle researchng and going back to my old notes. Another **challenge** I had was that I had trouble making the card on the right size, but i figured out through looking back at my notes. So what happened with my card was that it wasnt the same shape as the other cards. I fix this by researching about my problem and asking peers. I added `h-100` which allowed the height to be the full size. This helped make the card size even taking 100% of the card full height.    

**As you can see here the cards are now all even by applying:**
``` HTML
  <div class="card h-100">
```

Some take aways i ahve while making my MVP is to have an organized code. I did this by adding comments so I know where everything is located at, and what certain code does. To add comments you do `<!-- text -->`. So you can use this to help you locatr where thhings are at. forexample Im coding about Music production, one of the things im writing about for music production is Music software. So i have a long list of code for that music software section and i will end up getting confuse when finding it. So i added a comment which is like a green text.
